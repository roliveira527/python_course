This is a multi-line comment in Python.
This section covers Data Types.

Primitive Data Types:

- int => integers => whole numbers such as: 3  300  245
- float => floating point => numbers with a decimal point such as: 10.2  15.674  3425.0
- str => string => ordered sequence of characters such as: "hello"  "Ricardo"  "flight1234Z"

Data Structures:

- list => lists => ordered sequence of objects: [10, "hello", 45.6]
- dict => dictionary => unordered key:value pairs: {"myKey" : "value", "name" : "Ricardo"}
- tup => tuple => ordered immutable sequence of objects: (10, "hello", 45.6)
- set => sets => unordered collection of unique objects: {"a", "b"}
- bool => boolean => logical value: True / False

This section cover Numerical Operators in Python.

Basic Arithmetic Operators:

+ => Addition
- => Subtraction
/ => Division
* => Multiplication

Exponential Operator:

2 to the power of 3 === 2 ** 3 = 8

Modulo/Mod Operator:

This operator returns the remainder of a division operation.

eg.

7 / 4 = 1.75
4 goes into 7 once with remainder of 3.

7 % 4 = 3
