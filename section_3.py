This is a multi-line comment in Python.
This section covers Data Types.

Primitive Data Types:

- int => integers => whole numbers such as: 3  300  245
- float => floating point => numbers with a decimal point such as: 10.2  15.674  3425.0
- str => string => ordered sequence of characters such as: "hello"  "Ricardo"  "flight1234Z"

Data Structures:

- list => lists => ordered sequence of objects: [10, "hello", 45.6]
- dict => dictionary => unordered key:value pairs: {"myKey" : "value", "name" : "Ricardo"}
- tup => tuple => ordered immutable sequence of objects: (10, "hello", 45.6)
- set => sets => unordered collection of unique objects: {"a", "b"}
- bool => boolean => logical value: True / False



This section covers Numerical Operators in Python.

Basic Arithmetic Operators:

+ => Addition
- => Subtraction
/ => Division
* => Multiplication

Exponential Operator:

2 to the power of 3 === 2 ** 3 = 8

Modulo/Mod Operator:

This operator returns the remainder of a division operation.

eg.

7 / 4 = 1.75
4 goes into 7 once with remainder of 3.

7 % 4 = 3



This section covers Variable Assignments.

In Python variable naming follows a few rules:
    Names cannot start with a number.
    There can be no spaces in the name, we instead must use '_'.
    We cannot use any of the following symbols: :'",<>/?|\()!@#$%^&*~-+
    
Best practise under the PEP8 convention says variables should be typed in lowercase.
It's also recommended to avoid using key words in Python such as "list" or "str".

Python is a dynamically typed language, which means that you can reassign variables to different data types.
This makes Python very flexible and stand out from other languages that are statically typed.

eg.

my_dogs = 2
my_dogs = ["Stake", "Bones"]

This code will compile and run in Python, but in a different language such as C++ it will throw an error.

Pros:
    Very easy to work with.
    Faster development time.
Cons:
    May result in bugs for unexpected data types.
    You need to be aware of type().
